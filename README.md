### Icons Directory: 

Ignore this directory.

I considered modifying directories in nautilus to look different if they were git repos.
But now I just use and recommend:
- [RabbitVCS](https://github.com/rabbitvcs/rabbitvcs) (For Linux) or
- [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) (or TortoiseHG/TortoiseSVN) (For Windows).

They're super handy if you use explorer/nautilus at all and would like to see at a glance the state of your commits (<ins>note:</ins> it doesn't show upstream comparison).


~But I'm keeping these anyway in case they come in handy later (sunken cost fallacy maybe, after the effort of modifying the icons in GIMP). Maybe I'll do something cool with them eventually. I don't know.~

~- The folder is the one found at /usr/share/icons/Yaru/256x256@2x/apps. I have Jammy Jellyfish as my home version so using that directory made sense to me.~
~- The github icon is the one labelled "github emoji" found [here](https://iconduck.com/emojis/47417/github).~
