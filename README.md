# salem-setup
My home setup of configurations for ease-of-use in my development environment. I will eventually (hopefully soon) automate this.

The icon I modified with GIMP.

- The folder is the one found at /usr/share/icons/Yaru. I have Jammy Jellyfish as my home version.

- The gihub icon is the one labelled "github emoji" found here:
