# Salem Home Setup
Some of my home setup or quick access configurations, templates, scripts and such for ease-of-use in my development environment. 

### Django Directory
To save time setting up finicky Django settings and integrating environment variables when one can just follow a template example and copy and paste. It was enough searching learning how to do it the first time and testing everything.
This was based off a project made in Django 4.2.6.

### ICONS Directory: 
I considered modifying directories in nautilus to look different if they were git repos, but now I just use rabbitvcs https://github.com/rabbitvcs/rabbitvcs which is super handy if you use explorer/nautilus at all. The windows equivalent is called Tortoise (or TortoiseGit / TortoiseHG or TortoiseSVN).

But I'm keeping these anyway in case they come in handy later (sunken cost fallacy maybe, after the effort of modifying the icons in GIMP).

- The folder is the one found at /usr/share/icons/Yaru/256x256@2x/apps. I have Jammy Jellyfish as my home version so using that directory made sense to me.
- The github icon is the one labelled "github emoji" found here:
https://iconduck.com/emojis/47417/github
